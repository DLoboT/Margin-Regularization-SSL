# Margin Regularization to Improve SAR Crop-Classification using-Self-Supervised-Learning

PyTorch implementation and pretrained models for our approach SimSiam with Margin Regularization. For details, see (put link)

## Description

This paper presents a self-supervised approach that uses the redundancy reduction principle to create a model with better generalization properties and robustness for crop classification as the downstream task, especially beneficial for imbalanced datasets, such as those usually observed in crop classification. Specifically, we combine the unsupervised pretext task of self-supervised methods with a notion of margin that enables efficient mapping of hard samples in the latent space, ultimately improving the crop classification downstream task. We report a consistent improvement in the classification accuracy compared to a baseline self-supervised method without margin, narrowing the gap between the SSL method and the fully supervised one.
